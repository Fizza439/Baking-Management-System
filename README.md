### **Banking Management System (Java)**

Banking Management System (Java)
The Banking Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to simulate and manage core banking operations with high efficiency, modular design, and robust security. It integrates real-world banking roles with strong object-oriented principles and core data structure implementations.

🔑 Key Features by Role:
Teller: Handles deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and real-time balance inquiries with transaction validation.

Customer Service Representative (CSR): Manages customer profiles, updates personal data, retrieves transaction history, and assists with account services.

Loan Officer: Evaluates and processes loan applications, calculates interest, and manages approval or rejection processes.

Manager: Oversees full system control including employee accounts, high-level transaction approvals, audit reporting, and performance monitoring.

Employee Management: Employees are dynamically created and managed using a Linked List, allowing flexible addition, removal, and updates.

🧠 Core Computer Science Concepts:
Data Structures Used:

Linked List: For dynamic employee record management.

Queue: To handle customer service requests in FIFO order.

Stack: For transaction history tracking and undo functionality.

Algorithms:

Search and sorting algorithms for account and loan data.

Validation algorithms to ensure input integrity and secure login systems.

Transaction flow control using conditional logic and role-based access algorithms.

🔒 Security Features:

Password validation and input sanitization to prevent breaches.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Java (Core + OOP)

GUI elements (if applicable)

File Handling or basic database (if implemented)

Modular coding structure for easy scalability

This Banking Management System is an excellent demonstration of real-world banking logic integrated with foundational Data Structures and Algorithms, making it ideal for learning as well as showcasing practical Java development skills.
